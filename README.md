# Project Name

**Author**: Roger Reyes & Kyle Honaker
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This server has data that is sent in to MongoDB. It is then called and passed to the front end to render to tehe UI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your lcoal drive
2. in your terminal change your directory to the repository you cloned
3. in your terminal type `npm i` to install all dependencies
4. Once the dependencies are loaded go ahead and open the file in your IDE (optional)
5. in your terminal type `nodemon` or `npm start` to start the server

## Architecture

The architecture consists of React.js, MongoDB, Heroku, and Netlify

## Change Log

Day 1 (Apr-15): The initial commits were done. We made handshakes between the server, MongoDB, and the front-end happen. The UI populates our book information based off of MongoDB.

Kyle - Front end, taking good notes, quick, ‘marathon coder’
Roger - Back end, task prioritization, code explanation

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**
We both have 2 sides of the coin. Help each other out with Front/Back end. Work well with task prioritization and accountability.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**
Roger - re-factorization and styling
Kyle - Back end (in general) and loops

Discuss POD tasks and goals. Create a game plan.
Conflict Resolution

Communicate - Ask for tasks “Where can I help?”

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
Communicate issues, communicate often on completion of tasks, open table discussion
